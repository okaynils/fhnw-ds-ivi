\chapter{Introduction}

As a final-year undergraduate student in Data Science, I've spent the past few years honing my skills in understanding and interpreting data, with a passion for transforming insights into meaningful narratives. Last summer, I had the opportunity to visit Sweden, where I was enchanted by the sounds of birds waking me up each morning. The experience left a lasting impression on me and left me curious about the vibrant birdlife of Sweden.

Now, as I prepare to take the next step in my academic journey by applying to master's programs in Sweden, I've decided to combine my passion for data and this personal connection to Sweden's natural beauty. Through this project, I aim to explore and learn about the country I will soon call home for the next two years, as well as the diverse bird species that inhabit it.

The \textit{Birds of Sweden Dashboard} is my attempt to bridge these interests. It serves as an interactive tool to visualize and learn about bird species commonly found in Sweden, their habitats, and their distribution. Beyond fulfilling academic objectives, this project has been a deeply personal journey of discovery.
