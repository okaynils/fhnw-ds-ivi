  abstract = {Autonomization often follows after the automization on which it is based. More and more machines have to make decisions with moral implications. Machine ethics, which can be seen as an equivalent of human ethics, analyses the chances and limits of moral machines. So far, decision trees have not been commonly used for modelling moral machines. This article proposes an approach for creating annotated decision trees, and specifies their central components. The focus is on simple moral machines. The chances of such models are illustrated with the example of a selfdriving car that is friendly to humans and animals. Finally the advantages and disadvantages are discussed and conclusions are drawn.},

The neuro device inserted in its brain was able to pick up the impulses and translate them into computer commands. Not very long ago, researchers presented an experiment in which a human patient diagnosed with severe depression had a neuro chip inserted in her brain to regulate her emotions. The fact that these major discoveries are not accompanied by equally well funded research to investigate the social, political and ethical implications that such results may have reveals the importance of this debate. The ethical challenges of human-computer interaction discoveries are themselves at the beginning since it is very difficult to keep up with the latest results. Nevertheless, it is vital that we start asking the important questions and put forward challenging hypotheses, since technology will not only be part\,=\,of our lives, abut also of our bodies.},

Though many sources describe the foundations of the domain, few discuss practical methods for solving visualization problems. One frequently cited guideline to design is the “Visual Information-Seeking Mantra”, proposed by Shneiderman in 1996. Although often used to inform the design of information visualization systems, it is unclear what use this has been for visualization designers. We reviewed the current literature that references the Mantra, noting what authors have found useful about it and why they cite it. The results indicate a need for empirical validation of the Mantra and for a method, such as design patterns, to inform a holistic approach to visualisation design.},

The purpose is to clarify common misconceptions and false expectations of the capabilities of the different classes of parallel rendering software. We examine the rendering pipeline of the typical visualization application and identify the typical bottlenecks found in this pipeline. The methods used for parallel rendering are classified in three fundamental approaches and then analyzed with respect to their influence on this rendering pipeline, which leads to conclusions about possible performance gains and the necessary porting effort. We advocate the need for a generic, open parallel rendering framework to build scalable graphics software. The drawbacks of other existing solutions are outlined, and a full software stack for graphics clusters is proposed. The Equalizer project1 aims to provide such an implementation, combining existing software packages with newly developed middleware.},

We surveyed experienced narrative visualization practitioners to investigate their methods of evaluation. To gain deeper insight we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with practitioners. We found that there is usually an informal approach to narrative visualization evaluation, where practitioners rely on prior experience and their peers for evaluation. Our study also revealed novel approaches to evaluation. We introduce a practice-led heuristic framework to aid practitioners to evaluate narrative visualization systematically. Our practice-led heuristic framework couples first-hand practitioner experience with recent research literature. This work sheds light on how to address narrative visualization evaluation to better inform both academic research and practice.},

  abstract = {The ethics of autonomous vehicles (AV) has received a great amount of attention in recent years, specifically in regard to their decisional policies in accident situations in which human harm is a likely consequence. Starting from the assumption that human harm is unavoidable, many authors have developed differing accounts of what morality requires in these situations. In this article, a strategy for AV decision-making is proposed, the Ethical Valence Theory, which paints AV decision-making as a type of claim mitigation: different road users hold different moral claims on the vehicle’s behavior, and the vehicle must mitigate these claims as it makes decisions about its environment. Using the context of autonomous vehicles, the harm produced by an action and the uncertainties connected to it are quantified and accounted for through deliberation, resulting in an ethical implementation coherent with reality. The goal of this approach is not to define how moral theory requires vehicles to behave, but rather to provide a computational approach that is flexible enough to accommodate a number of ‘moral positions’ concerning what morality demands and what road users may expect, offering an evaluation tool for the social acceptability of an autonomous vehicle’s ethical decision making.},

While often used for medical purposes, BCIs may also hold great promise for nonmedical purposes to unlock human neurocognitive potential. In this Essay, we discuss the prospects and challenges of using BCIs for cognitive enhancement, focusing specifically on invasive enhancement BCIs (eBCIs). We discuss the ethical, legal, and scientific implications of eBCIs, including issues related to privacy, autonomy, inequality, and the broader societal impact of cognitive enhancement technologies. We conclude that the development of eBCIs raises challenges far beyond practical pros and cons, prompting fundamental questions regarding the nature of conscious selfhood and about who—and what—we are, and ought, to be.},

This article provides a broad overview of realistic ethical issues related to self-driving vehicles. Some of the major topics covered are as follows: Strong opinions for and against driverless cars may give rise to severe social and political conflicts. A low tolerance for accidents caused by driverless vehicles may delay the introduction of driverless systems that would substantially reduce the risks. Trade-offs will arise between safety and other requirement on the road traffic system. Over-reliance on the swift collision-avoiding reactions of self-driving vehicles can induce people to take dangerous actions, such as stepping out in front of a car, relying on its fast braking. Children travelling alone can violate safety instructions such as the use of seatbelts. Digital information about routes and destinations can be used to convey commercial and political messages to car users. If fast passage can be bought, then socio-economic segregation of road traffic may result. Terrorists and other criminals can hack into a vehicle and make it crash. They can also use self-driving vehicles for instance to carry bombs to their designed places of detonation or to wreak havoc on a country’s road system.},

For example, the Nevada Solar Energy-Water-Environmental Nexus project has been generating a large amount of environmental monitoring data in textual format. As the data is available on the web, a web-based visualization tool is desirable for the project rather than a standalone tool. This research analyzes the processing mechanisms of four popular web-based data visualization tools, that is, Google Charts, Flex, OFC, D3, and compares their performances. A standalone visualization tool, JfreeChart, have been also used for comparison. The processing times have been divided into three segments, layout time, data transformation time, and rendering time, and separately measured. The actual temperature data from the Nevada Nexus project has been used for testing in different scales ranging from 100 to 100,000 data points. The result shows that each visualization tool has its own ideal environment.},

  urldate = {2023-12-07},
  abstract = {Legends are commonly used with data visualizations when there is more than one color or line type being used – most commonly in maps. By moving labels outside of a visualization, legends can help to reduce clutter and make your data visualization more user-friendly as a result.   Legends always include a series of item markers with corresponding labels and can optionally include a title. When using legends, be sure to follow the guidance below.   Placement        Legends should be placed below or parallel to a data visualization, depending on the type of data being labeled and the available space surrounding the data visualization. If using sequential or diverging data, ensure that the legend is displayed in a vertical format next to the visualization so that the data can be properly ordered.      Title        A legend title is not necessary to include. When it is included however, it should be descriptive and reinforce the title or subtitle of the visualization. Instead of using a generic title like “Legend” or “Key,” try using a title that captures the meaning of the data being labeled, such as “Population per Square Mile.”                    Acceptable Example       Legend       Why it's Only Acceptable                The legend title missed an opportunity to include helpful information about the kind of data inside of the data visualization. If you are including a legend title, be sure to make it descriptive.                          Preferred Example       Population per Square Mile       Why it‘s Preferred                Now that the legend title describes the type of data being visualized, users will have a better sense of what the data visualization is all about.                  Ordering Elements        When using sequential data, ensure that the highest number appears first at the top of the legend and the lowest number appears last at the bottom of the legend. For diverging data, a vertical legend is also recommended, with the most extreme values at opposite ends of the legend.                    Failed Example                Average Winter Temperature               -9 to 0               1 to 10               11 to 20               21-30               31-40              Why it Fails                By displaying the data in ascending order, the lower numbers appear at         the top of the legend. This type of order deviates from best practices         in usability. It is also important to maintain consistent ordering across         legends, especially when displaying visualizations in a series.                          Preferred Example                Average Winter Temperature               31-40               21-30               11 to 20               1 to 10               -9 to 0              Why it‘s Preferred                Now that the data is displayed in descending order, the legend adheres         to best practices and will result in more consistent and therefore more         user-friendly data visualizations.},

  abstract = {Structures suffer from the emergence of cracks, therefore, crack detection is always an issue with much concern in structural health monitoring. Along with the rapid progress of deep learning technology, image semantic segmentation, an active research field, offers another solution, which is more effective and intelligent, to crack detection Through numerous artificial neural networks have been developed to address the preceding issue, corresponding explorations are never stopped improving the quality of crack detection. This paper presents a novel artificial neural network architecture named Full Attention U-net for image semantic segmentation. The proposed architecture leverages the U-net as the backbone and adopts the Full Attention Strategy, which is a synthesis of the attention mechanism and the outputs from each encoding layer in skip connection. Subject to the hardware in training, the experiments are composed of verification and validation. In verification, 4 networks including U-net, Attention U-net, Advanced Attention U-net, and Full Attention U-net are tested through cell images for a competitive study. With respect to mean intersection-over-unions and clarity of edge identification, the Full Attention U-net performs best in verification, and is hence applied for crack semantic segmentation in validation to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

AGs can be easily integrated into standard CNN architectures such as the U-Net model with minimal computational overhead while increasing the model sensitivity and prediction accuracy. The proposed Attention U-Net architecture is evaluated on two large CT abdominal datasets for multi-class image segmentation. Experimental results show that AGs consistently improve the prediction performance of U-Net across different datasets and training sizes while preserving computational efficiency.

The tendency in recent years has been to harness the potential of GPUs to perform the level-of-detail extraction on graphics hardware. The aim of this work is to present a new level-of-detail scheme based on triangles which is both simple and efficient. In this approach, the extraction process updates vertices instead of indices, thus providing a perfect framework for adapting the algorithms to work completely on GPU shaders. One of the key aspects of our proposal is the need for just a single rendering pass in order to obtain the desired geometry. Moreover, coherence among the different approximations is maximized by means of a symmetric extraction algorithm, which performs the same process when refining and coarsening the mesh. Lastly, we also introduce different uses of the scheme to offer continuous and view-dependent resolution.},

While BCI systems are promising for future medical and non-medical applications, studies concerning their ethical considerations are growing. However, no previous study has examined how the public’s ethical perception of the BCI technology is affected by the particular BCI type in question. This study thus considered whether the public experienced active and passive BCIs differently in the prominent ethical domains of personhood, responsibility and privacy. Results suggest that active BCIs induce a higher ethical concern regarding personhood, and that women experienced privacy to be more concerning in passive BCIs. There were no other significant differences between the two BCI types in the examined ethical domains. A regression analysis also indicated that a person’s general ethical concern for BCIs was unaffected by their demographical information. This study provides preliminary insights for the development of ethically informed BCI systems.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

  abstract = {The article presents the application of a hyperspectral camera in mobile robot navigation. Hyperspectral cameras are imaging systems that can capture a wide range of electromagnetic spectra. This feature allows them to detect a broader range of colors and features than traditional cameras and to perceive the environment more accurately. Several surface types, such as mud, can be challenging to detect using an RGB camera. In our system, the hyperspectral camera is used for ground recognition (e.g., grass, bumpy road, asphalt). Traditional global path planning methods take the shortest path length as the optimization objective. We propose an improved A* algorithm to generate the collision-free path. Semantic information makes it possible to plan a feasible and safe path in a complex off-road environment, taking traveling time as the optimization objective. We presented the results of the experiments for data collected in a natural environment. An important novelty of this paper is using a modified nearest neighbor method for hyperspectral data analysis and then using the data for path planning tasks in the same work. Using the nearest neighbor method allows us to adjust the robotic system much faster than using neural networks. As our system is continuously evolving, we intend to examine the performance of the vehicle on various road surfaces, which is why we sought to create a classification system that does not require a prolonged learning process. In our paper, we aimed to demonstrate that the incorporation of a hyperspectral camera can not only enhance route planning but also aid in the determination of parameters such as speed and acceleration.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in machine learning have enabled its wide application in different domains, and one of the most exciting applications is autonomous vehicles (AVs), which have encouraged the development of a number of ML algorithms from perception to prediction to planning. However, training AVs usually requires a large amount of training data collected from different driving environments (e.g., cities) as well as different types of personal information (e.g., working hours and routes). Such collected large data, treated as the new oil for ML in the data-centric AI era, usually contains a large amount of privacy-sensitive information which is hard to remove or even audit. Although existing privacy protection approaches have achieved certain theoretical and empirical success, there is still a gap when applying them to real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles. For instance, when training AVs, not only can individually identifiable information reveal privacy-sensitive information, but also population-level information such as road construction within a city, and proprietary-level commercial secrets of AVs. Thus, it is critical to revisit the frontier of privacy risks and corresponding protection approaches in AVs to bridge this gap. Following this goal, in this work, we provide a new taxonomy for privacy risks and protection methods in AVs, and we categorize privacy in AVs into three levels: individual, population, and proprietary. We explicitly list out recent challenges to protect each of these levels of privacy, summarize existing solutions to these challenges, discuss the lessons and conclusions, and provide potential future directions and opportunities for both researchers and practitioners. We believe this work will help to shape the privacy research in AV and guide the privacy protection technology design.},

  abstract = {Datasets drive vision progress, yet existing driving datasets are impoverished in terms of visual content and supported tasks to study multitask learning for autonomous driving. Researchers are usually constrained to study a small set of problems on one dataset, while real-world computer vision applications require performing tasks of various complexities. We construct BDD100K, the largest driving video dataset with 100K videos and 10 tasks to evaluate the exciting progress of image recognition algorithms on autonomous driving. The dataset possesses geographic, environmental, and weather diversity, which is useful for training models that are less likely to be surprised by new conditions. Based on this diverse dataset, we build a benchmark for heterogeneous multitask learning and study how to solve the tasks together. Our experiments show that special training strategies are needed for existing models to perform such heterogeneous tasks. BDD100K opens the door for future studies in this important venue.},

  abstract = {Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a technology that allows the exchange of information between a brain and a computer. Today, BCIs have been developed primarily to serve the medical field as a tool for prosthesis and treatment. As the trajectory of BCIs shifts to more complex and widespread applications in metaverse, the future of BCIs is projected to expand to many other sectors of society, such as communication, education, and motor enhancement. However, the current and prospective developments of BCIs raise concerns for the preservation of privacy and ethics in BCI usage. In this paper, I will explore the privacy and ethical concerns of both current and prospective applications of BCIs. I will discuss current BCI methods, including BCI neuroprosthetics, neuromodulation treatments, and close-loop devices. My anticipation of future BCI methods will center around BCI applications in the context of communication, education, and motor enhancement. I will analyze each method’s implications on privacy and ethics, and address possible concerns with potential solutions.},
